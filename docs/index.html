                At MathForces, we believe that mastery is
                only achieved through challenge. We are devoted
                to providing a platform and database where students
                of mathematics can solve challenges and improve their
                skills. We also hope to plan a universal rating
                system to help people study specific problem sets
                at their personal skill level.
